I am an assistant professor at the [Institute of Political Studies of the Polish Academy of Sciences](http://english.isppan.waw.pl/), and until March 2022 a visiting researcher at the [Research and Expertise Centre for Survey Methodology](https://www.upf.edu/web/survey) at Universitat Pompeu Fabra in Barcelona where I work on issues related to my project on the polarization of political trust (funded by Poland's National Science Centre, 2019/32/C/HS6/00421). 

I was also a visiting researcher at the [Probabilistic Machine Learning Group](https://research.cs.aalto.fi/pml/), Department of Computer Science, Aalto University (2020-2021) and at the [Chair for Central and Eastern European Studies](https://www.tu-chemnitz.de/phil/iesg/professuren/klome/index.php.en), Technical University of Chemnitz (2019-2020). 

My research interests include comparative analyses of political attitudes and behavior across nations and over time, as well as the methodology of comparative research, in particular cross-national surveys.
