My current research deals with the causes and consequences of political trust. The issues I will explore include the effects of economic, institutional, and democratic performance on political trust, their relative importance and differences across countries; and the association between political polarization and political trust. The grant is funded by the Polish National Science Centre (2019/32/C/HS6/00421).

Methodologically, I am particularly interested in model-based approaches to *ex post* harmonization of cross-national surveys, and ways of incorporating cross-surveys in measurement and sample representativeness in the models rather than by recoding or other *ad hoc* adjustments. 

I'm also working on tools that facilitate [ex-post harmonzation of survey data](https://github.com/mkolczynska/harmonization-toolbox).
