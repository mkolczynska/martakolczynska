## Step 1. Install R

Probably the most useful thing I learned in grad school is that there is an R package for everything, including [cocktails](https://github.com/shabbychef/cocktailApp), getting [colors from Dutch paintings](https://github.com/vankesteren/rijkspalette), and - obviously - [blogging](https://github.com/rstudio/blogdown).


## Step 2. Find a tutorial

My favorite quote from [*blogdown: Creating Websites with R Markdown*](https://bookdown.org/yihui/blogdown/) by Yihui Xie, Amber Thomas, Alison Presmanes Hill:

> If you do not understand HTML, CSS, or JavaScript, and have no experience with Hugo themes or templates, it may take you about 10 minutes to get started with your new website ... if you do have the knowledge and experience (and desire to highly customize your site), it may take you several days to get started. Hugo is really powerful. Be cautious with power.

What am I going to do with all this saved time?

## Step 3. Find people who have been there before

Blogdown and Hugo have become so popular that there are countless resources to support newbies, including advice for using particular templates (especially Academic, but also others).

## Step 4. Have fun

The great thing about blogdown and hugo is that it is very easy to make something that works, and then tweak it forever as time allows.
