<p>The climate protests in March 2019 mobilized over a million of people around the globe. A team of social scientists from universities across Europe organized a survey of the #FridaysForFuture strike events on March 15 in 13 cities in nine countries. The report can be found <a href="https://osf.io/xcnzh/" target="_blank">here</a>. A new wave of climate protests (and surveys) is planned for the end of September.</p>
<p>Naturally, most participants at these protests are acutely aware of the environmental threats and motivated to take action. But what is the situation like among the general population?</p>
<p>Here is a quick summary with data from the <a href="https://europeanvaluesstudy.eu/" target="_blank">European Values Study</a> wave 5 (from the 2nd pre-release in July 2019), using the <a href="https://github.com/jbryer/likert" target="_blank"><code>likert</code> package</a>.</p>
