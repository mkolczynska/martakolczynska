<p>My <a href="/post/sdr-exploration/">previous post</a> was about downloading and exploring the <a href="https://dataverse.harvard.edu/dataset.xhtml?persistentId=doi:10.7910/DVN/VWGF5Q">Survey Data Recycling (SDR), version 1.0 dataset</a>, which consists of selected harmonized variables from 22 survey projects, 1966-2013.</p>
<p>The <a href="dataharmonization.org">SDR project</a> will develop a website for browsing, subsetting, downloading, and visualizing data from the SDR project. This website is currently under construction. Meanwhile, basic functionalities of the future on-line browsing and subsetting tool are available here: <a href="https://mkolczynska.shinyapps.io/sdr_data_browser/" class="uri">https://mkolczynska.shinyapps.io/sdr_data_browser/</a></p>
