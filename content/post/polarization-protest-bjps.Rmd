The 2020 paper ["Deprivation in the Midst of Plenty: Citizen Polarization and Political Protest"](https://doi.org/10.1017/S0007123419000681) 
by Griffin, Kiewiet de Jonge, and Velasco-Guachalla, published by in 
British Journal of Political Science, 
contains a data error that invalidates the study's main 
results and conclusions that polarization leads to higher protest activity. 
The error is quite trivial and lies in the construction of the dependent variable of the study. 
After fixing the data error the results no longer indicate a 
positive effect of polarization on protest, nor a moderating effect of grievances.

The paper's original replication materials are in [this Dataverse repository](https://doi.org/10.7910/DVN/SVXE7L).

I starts with a brief summary of the theoretical argument and the data and measures 
used. Next, I explain the source of the error, reproduce the original analysis and 
present the corrected analyses after the data error is fixed.

## Summary of Griffin et al.

The theoretical argument builds on Ted Gurr's grievance theory to argue that the 
main determinant of protest is not the level of grievances itself, but 
the polarization of grievances. High polarization of grievances, i.e. a situation 
when some groups in a society are very dissatisfied, while others are very 
satisfied, is conducive to protest eruption because it implies feelings 
of relative deprivation among the dissatisfied group, who compare themselves to the 
satisfied groups.

The scope conditions, according to the authors, include the requirement of a democratic 
context, and - relatedly - peaceful anti-government protest rather than collective 
violence.

The measure of polarization is constructed as a sample standard deviation of 
responses to the question about satisfaction with democracy from various 
cross-national survey projects. It is measured at the country-year level.

The level of protest is measured as the number of anti-government protests and strikes 
at the country-year level, taken from the 
[Cross National Time Series (CNTS)](https://www.cntsdata.com/) dataset. It 
too is measured at the country-year level.


## Data inspection

I should note that I have not attempted to reproduce the measure of polarization, nor 
have I paid much attention to how the control variables were constructed. I just focus 
on the protest measure, i.e. the dependent variable of the study.

The file `Conflict data sample` in the [replication materials](https://doi.org/10.7910/DVN/SVXE7L) 
contains the protest data used in the article to construct the dependent variable. 
Here is a snippet for Poland 1981-1990. 
The variable `protest` is the one created by the authors and used in the analysis. 
In the article, it is described as the 
sum of strikes (`strike`) and anti-government demonstrations (`demons`). 
It is enough to eyeball the data to see that the variable 'protest' is not a sum of 
`strike` and `demons`. Rather, the variable `protest` looks like `strike` + `riot`.

I checked the original CTNS data downloaded following instructions on 
the [CTNS project website](https://www.cntsdata.com/). Below is the data snippet for 
Poland in 1981-1990. The 
counts of demonstrations, riots, and strikes registered in Poland 1981-1990 
match the numbers in the Griffin et al. replication data file.

The error in creating the `protest` variable looks trivial. 
The authors must have added together the wrong data columns. This is an easy mistake to make 
if the CTNS data are imported into data analysis software with only the short variable 
names (`domestic2`, `domestic3`, ...) and not full labels.


## Reanalysis

I start by downloading the data files from the authors' Dataverse repository.

```{r getting-data}

library(tidyverse) # for manipulating data
library(dataverse) # for getting data from Dataverse
library(zoo) # for interpolating
library(skimr) # for making quick data summarise
library(kableExtra) # for making tables
library(glmmTMB) # for running generalized linear mixed models
library(sjPlot) # model tables (and much more!)

# Polarization dataset
polarization <- get_dataframe_by_name(
  filename = "Polarization dataset.tab",
  dataset = "10.7910/DVN/SVXE7L", 
  server = "dataverse.harvard.edu")

# Protest dataset
conflict <- get_dataframe_by_name(
  filename = "Conflict data sample.tab",
  dataset = "10.7910/DVN/SVXE7L", 
  server = "dataverse.harvard.edu")

# Control variables dataset
qog <- get_dataframe_by_name(
  filename = "QOG sample.tab",
  dataset = "10.7910/DVN/SVXE7L", 
  server = "dataverse.harvard.edu")

```

The code below is a translation of the Stata code in `Polarization_Protest models.do` 
from the replication materials to R. 

```{r data-prep}

combo <- polarization %>%
  # merge all datasets by country and year
  full_join(conflict, by = c("ccode", "Year")) %>%
  full_join(qog, by = c("ccode", "Year")) %>%
  mutate(# correct measure of anti-gov demonstrations + strikes
         demons_strike = demons + strike,
         # riots + strikes
         riot_strike = riot + strike,
         # other transformations as in the original data cleaning script
         polar = polar*100,
         disat = disat*100,
         GDPcap = log(pwt_rgdpch),
         Growth = wdi_gdpgr,
         Inflation = wdi_infl,
         Ln_Inflation = ifelse(Inflation >= 1, log(Inflation), 0),
         polity2 = p_polity2,
         Eth_frag = al_ethnic,
         Ln_pop = log(wdi_pop),
         Elec_leg = dpi_legelec,
         Elec_exe = dpi_exelec,
         ENP = gol_enpp,
         Presidential = as.numeric(dpi_system == 0),
         Presidential = ifelse(is.na(dpi_system), 0, Presidential),
         Urban = wdi_urban,
         reg_durability = p_durable,
         terror = gd_ptss,
         timetrend = Year - 2000
         ) %>%
  arrange(Country, Year) %>%
  group_by(Country) %>%
  # interpolate income inequality
  mutate(gini = zoo::na.approx(solt_ginet, na.rm = F)) %>%
  ungroup() %>%
  # keep democracies only
  filter(polity2 >= 0) %>%
  # created lagged and centered variables
  mutate_at(vars(protest, demons_strike, riot_strike, demons, riot, strike, polar, disat, gini,
                 GDPcap, Growth, Inflation, Ln_Inflation, Elec_leg, Elec_exe, polity2, reg_durability,
                 terror, Urban, Ln_pop),
            .funs = list(l = ~lag((. - mean(., na.rm = T)), 1))) %>%
  # drop cases with missing lagged polarization
  drop_na(polar_l) %>%
  select(ccode, Year, demons_strike, demons_strike_l, riot_strike, riot_strike_l,
         protest, protest_l, polar_l, disat_l, gini_l, GDPcap_l,
         Growth_l, Ln_Inflation_l, Elec_leg_l, Elec_exe_l, polity2_l,
         reg_durability_l, terror_l, Urban_l, Ln_pop_l, Presidential,
         Eth_frag, timetrend)

```

Here's the summary of all relevant variables. Note that the `protest` variable, 
constructed by the Griffin et al., and the `riot_strike` variable, constructed by myself 
as a sum of the number of riots and strikes, are the same.

```{r, skimr_digits = 3}

skimr::skim(combo) %>%
  mutate(numeric.mean = round(numeric.mean, 3)) %>%
  mutate(numeric.sd = round(numeric.sd, 3)) %>%
  mutate(numeric.p0 = round(numeric.p0, 3)) %>%
  mutate(numeric.p100 = round(numeric.p100, 3)) %>%
  dplyr::select(skim_variable, n_missing, numeric.mean, numeric.sd, numeric.p0, numeric.p100) %>%
  print(n = 25)

```

And here is a summary of the data created with the authors' original code. 
The summary statistics in the table below are the same as in the table above, 
up to rounding error.

## Results

The authors estimate negative binomial count models predicting the number of events. 
They present both "flat" models with errors clustered by country 
and multilevel models with country-years nested in countries. I focus on the latter. 

### Main effects

The code below reproduces Model specification 2 with country random effects from 
Table 1 in Griffin et al. - model `protest` in the output table below. The second model 
replaces the original `protest` variable with the sum of counts of demonstrations and 
strikes, `demons_strike`. 

The crucial coefficient is the effect of lagged polarization, 
`polar_l`. In the original model the coefficient is estimated at 0.046, significant at 
the 0.05 level. In the corrected model the coefficient equals 0.009 and is no longer significant.

Note that not all coefficient values of the `protest` model below are exactly the same as 
in the original table in Griffin et al. For example, the coefficient for lagged protest 
in the reanalysis below is 0.197, SE = 0.065, 
compared to 0.195, SE = 0.065 in the Griffin et al. paper. This is likely due to small differences in 
the estimation routine `menbreg` in Stata and in the R package `glmmTMB`. 
Coefficients for the effects of polarization are the same whether the model is estimated 
in R or Stata, and equal 0.009 with SE = 0.015.


```{r models-multilevel}

re_original <- glmmTMB(protest ~ protest_l + polar_l + disat_l + 
                         gini_l + I(gini_l^2) + GDPcap_l + Growth_l + Ln_Inflation_l + 
                         Elec_leg_l + Elec_exe_l + polity2_l + reg_durability_l + 
                         terror_l + Urban_l + Ln_pop_l + Presidential + Eth_frag + timetrend +
                  (1 | ccode),
                  data = combo,
                  ziformula = ~0,
                  family = nbinom2)

re_corrected <- glmmTMB(demons_strike ~ demons_strike_l + polar_l + disat_l + 
                          gini_l + I(gini_l^2) + GDPcap_l + Growth_l + Ln_Inflation_l + 
                          Elec_leg_l + Elec_exe_l + polity2_l + reg_durability_l + 
                          terror_l + Urban_l + Ln_pop_l + Presidential + Eth_frag + timetrend +
                  (1 | ccode),
                  data = combo,
                  ziformula = ~0,
                  family = nbinom2)

sjPlot::tab_model(re_original, re_corrected, show.ci = FALSE, show.se = TRUE, transform = NULL,
                  digits = 3, emph.p = FALSE,
                  order.terms = c(2,20,3:19,1))


```


### Moderation

I now turn to model specification 3 with country random effects, which adds an interaction 
between polarization and dissatisfaction. The first model reproduces the one from the paper, 
the second one corrects the data error. 

In the reproduction the main effect of polarization is 0.044, SE = 0.019, significant at the 
0.05 level. The interaction effect equals -0.004, SE = 0.002, significant at the 0.1 level, 
like in the published paper.

After correcting the data error the main effect of polarization and the interaction 
effect become much smaller and neither is statistically significant.

```{r}
re_original_mod <- glmmTMB(protest ~ protest_l + polar_l*disat_l + 
                         gini_l + I(gini_l^2) + GDPcap_l + Growth_l + Ln_Inflation_l + 
                         Elec_leg_l + Elec_exe_l + polity2_l + reg_durability_l + 
                         terror_l + Urban_l + Ln_pop_l + Presidential + Eth_frag + timetrend +
                  (1 | ccode),
                  data = combo,
                  ziformula = ~0,
                  family = nbinom2)

re_corrected_mod <- glmmTMB(demons_strike ~ demons_strike_l + polar_l*disat_l + 
                          gini_l + I(gini_l^2) + GDPcap_l + Growth_l + Ln_Inflation_l + 
                          Elec_leg_l + Elec_exe_l + polity2_l + reg_durability_l + 
                          terror_l + Urban_l + Ln_pop_l + Presidential + Eth_frag + timetrend +
                  (1 | ccode),
                  data = combo,
                  ziformula = ~0,
                  family = nbinom2)

sjPlot::tab_model(re_original_mod, re_corrected_mod, show.ci = FALSE, show.se = TRUE, transform = NULL,
                  digits = 3, emph.p = FALSE,
                  order.terms = c(2,21,3,4,20,5:19,1))
```


## Conclusion

After fixing the data error the above analysis fails to provide evidence that 
polarization (or dispersion) of satisfaction with democracy predicts 
the total number of anti-government demonstrations and strikes.

The error needs to be corrected. I contacted the authors in January 2024 and 
BJPS in May 2024, and nothing has been done yet.
