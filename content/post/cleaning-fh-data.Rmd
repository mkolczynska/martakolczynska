How to clean a very untidy data set with Freedom House country ratings, saved in an Excel sheet, which violates many principles of data organization in spreadsheets described in [this paper by Karl Broman and Kara Woo](https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.1080/00031305.2017.1375989){target="_blank"}, but otherwise is an invaluable source of data on freedom in the world?

Data source: https://freedomhouse.org/content/freedom-world-data-and-resources

The full code used in this post is available [here](https://github.com/mkolczynska/martakolczynska/blob/master/content/post/cleaning-fh-data.Rmd){target="_blank"}.


I would do this:

(1) Read in the file,

(2) Transform everything into the long format - in R it's much easier to deal with data with columns than in rows,

(3) Notice how the data read in in step (1) look like: 
- column names '..odd_number' contain the Civil Liberties rating (CL), 
- '..even_number' contain the Status category, 
- the remaining columns contain the Political Rights rating (PR). 

Use this observation to identify the type of data and make meaningful labels.

(4) Add a year variable knowing that: (a) there are 3 different quantities (CL, PR, Status), (b) 206 countries, and (c) the range of years is 1973-2018.


```{r setup, warning=FALSE, message=FALSE, echo = FALSE, results='hide'}
library(rio) # for reading in excel data
library(knitr) # for displaying images
library(tidyverse) # for manipulating data
```

This is how the data look like in the Excel sheet:

```{r fig-xlsx, fig.cap="Excel sheet with Freedom House data.", out.width = "600px", echo = FALSE}
include_graphics("/images/fh-xlsx.png")
```

```{r read, warning=FALSE, message=FALSE}
fh <- import("data/Country and Territory Ratings and Statuses FIW1973-2018.xlsx", 
             sheet = 2, # read in data from the second sheet
             na = "-") # recode "-" to missing
```

This is how the data look like after loading to R:

```{r fig-readxlsx, fig.cap="Untidy data frame with Freedom House data.", out.width = "600px", echo = FALSE}
include_graphics("/images/fh-readxlsx.png")
```


```{r cleaning, warning=FALSE, message=FALSE}
names(fh)[1] <- "country"

fh_clean <- fh %>%
  filter(country != "Year(s) Under Review", # filter out the first row of data
         !is.na(country)) %>% # filter out the second row of data
  gather(var, value, 2:136) %>% # convert the whole data set to long format
  mutate(# identify the type of data following (3) above
         var1 = ifelse(substr(var, 1, 3) == "...", "CL/status", "PR"),
         var1 = ifelse(var1 == "CL/status" & as.numeric(substr(var, 4, 6)) %in% 2 == 0, "Status", "CL"),
         year = rep(1973:2017, each = 3*206)) %>% # create the year variable following (4) aboce
  select(country, year, var = var1, value)
```

This is how the data look like at the end:

```{r clean, warning=FALSE, message=FALSE}
head(fh_clean, 8)
```
