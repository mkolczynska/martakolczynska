      <description>Good surveys are all alike; every bad survey is bad in its own way.
Quality of survey data in cross-national projectsCross-national survey projects differ in many ways. This is evident to anyone who has used data from cross-national surveys: different projects vary with regard to: available questions, country and year coverage, formulations of questions on the same topic, response scales, amounts of item non-response, or the level of detail of the survey documentation.</description>

      <description>My previous post was about downloading and exploring the Survey Data Recycling (SDR), version 1.0 dataset, which consists of selected harmonized variables from 22 survey projects, 1966-2013.
The SDR project will develop a website for browsing, subsetting, downloading, and visualizing data from the SDR project. This website is currently under construction. Meanwhile, basic functionalities of the future on-line browsing and subsetting tool are available here: https://mkolczynska.shinyapps.io/sdr_data_browser/</description>

      <description>IntroductionCross-national survey projects are the standard data source for cross-national quantitative research in sociology. Such projects typically have similar questionnaires in all national surveys and - to a greater or lesser extent - standardized methodologies as well as documentation and reporting. Due to logistical challenges and interests of project leaders, cross-national survey projects remain limited in country and time coverage, which restricts opportunties for analalyses on a truly global scale.</description>

      <title>Measuring education: surveys vs. administrative records</title>

      <description>ProblemSocial surveys commonly ask about respondents’ educational attainment, either about the highest completed level of education, or about the number of completed years of schooling, and sometimes both. Survey measurements of individual education can be aggregated to indicate the overall level of education in the society. Information about the country’s level of education can also be obtained from administrative data, such as the World Bank or UNESCO.</description>
