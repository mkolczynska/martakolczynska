      <description>tl;dr: Combining data from different survey projects creates new opportunities for research, but the comes at a cost of increased complexity of the data.
Cross-national survey projects are the standard data source for cross-national quantitative research in sociology. Such projects typically have similar questionnaires in all national surveys and - to a greater or lesser extent - standardized methodologies as well as documentation and reporting. Due to logistical challenges and interests of project leaders, cross-national survey projects remain limited in country and time coverage, which restricts prevents analalyses on a global scale.</description>
