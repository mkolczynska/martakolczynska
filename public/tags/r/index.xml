      <description>ProblemSocial surveys commonly ask about respondents’ educational attainment, either about the highest completed level of education, or about the number of completed years of schooling, and sometimes both. Survey measurements of individual education can be aggregated to indicate the overall level of education in the society. Information about the country’s level of education can also be obtained from administrative data, such as the World Bank or UNESCO.</description>

      <description>My previous post was about downloading and exploring the Survey Data Recycling (SDR), version 1.0 dataset, which consists of selected harmonized variables from 22 survey projects, 1966-2013.
The SDR project will develop a website for browsing, subsetting, downloading, and visualizing data from the SDR project. This website is currently under construction. Meanwhile, basic functionalities of the future on-line browsing and subsetting tool are available here: https://mkolczynska.shinyapps.io/sdr_data_browser/</description>

      <description>IntroductionCross-national survey projects are the standard data source for cross-national quantitative research in sociology. Such projects typically have similar questionnaires in all national surveys and - to a greater or lesser extent - standardized methodologies as well as documentation and reporting. Due to logistical challenges and interests of project leaders, cross-national survey projects remain limited in country and time coverage, which restricts opportunties for analalyses on a truly global scale.</description>

      <description>Human capacity for generating ideas is greater than the capacity of developing ideas into papers.
So why write a blog and not keep a diary or a plain text file sitting safely on your hard drive, kochanie?
Because I can, because I want to, and I was encouraged by a colleague (cf. the three reasons for why people don&amp;rsquo;t participate in politics by Brady, Verba, and Scholzman 1995: 271).</description>
