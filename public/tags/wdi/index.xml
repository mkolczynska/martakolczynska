      <description>ProblemSocial surveys commonly ask about respondents’ educational attainment, either about the highest completed level of education, or about the number of completed years of schooling, and sometimes both. Survey measurements of individual education can be aggregated to indicate the overall level of education in the society. Information about the country’s level of education can also be obtained from administrative data, such as the World Bank or UNESCO.</description>

      <description>My previous post was about downloading and exploring the Survey Data Recycling (SDR), version 1.0 dataset, which consists of selected harmonized variables from 22 survey projects, 1966-2013.
The SDR project will develop a website for browsing, subsetting, downloading, and visualizing data from the SDR project. This website is currently under construction. Meanwhile, basic functionalities of the future on-line browsing and subsetting tool are available here: https://mkolczynska.shinyapps.io/sdr_data_browser/</description>
