      <description>The climate protests in March 2019 mobilized over a million of people around the globe. A team of social scientists from universities across Europe organized a survey of the #FridaysForFuture strike events on March 15 in 13 cities in nine countries. The report can be found here. A new wave of climate protests (and surveys) is planned for the end of September.
Naturally, most participants at these protests are acutely aware of the environmental threats and motivated to take action.</description>
