      <description>Good surveys are all alike; every bad survey is bad in its own way.
Quality of survey data in cross-national projectsCross-national survey projects differ in many ways. This is evident to anyone who has used data from cross-national surveys: different projects vary with regard to: available questions, country and year coverage, formulations of questions on the same topic, response scales, amounts of item non-response, or the level of detail of the survey documentation.</description>
