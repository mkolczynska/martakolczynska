      <description>ProblemSocial surveys commonly ask about respondents’ educational attainment, either about the highest completed level of education, or about the number of completed years of schooling, and sometimes both. Survey measurements of individual education can be aggregated to indicate the overall level of education in the society. Information about the country’s level of education can also be obtained from administrative data, such as the World Bank or UNESCO.</description>

      <description>My previous post was about downloading and exploring the Survey Data Recycling (SDR), version 1.0 dataset, which consists of selected harmonized variables from 22 survey projects, 1966-2013.
The SDR project will develop a website for browsing, subsetting, downloading, and visualizing data from the SDR project. This website is currently under construction. Meanwhile, basic functionalities of the future on-line browsing and subsetting tool are available here: https://mkolczynska.shinyapps.io/sdr_data_browser/</description>

      <description>IntroductionCross-national survey projects are the standard data source for cross-national quantitative research in sociology. Such projects typically have similar questionnaires in all national surveys and - to a greater or lesser extent - standardized methodologies as well as documentation and reporting. Due to logistical challenges and interests of project leaders, cross-national survey projects remain limited in country and time coverage, which restricts opportunties for analalyses on a truly global scale.</description>

      <description>This blog is going to be mostly about my adventures with R, primarily using survey data, and usually somewhat related to my social science interests; to share code and hopefully get feedback.
How it all started Human capacity for generating ideas is greater than the capacity of developing ideas into papers.
So why write a blog and not keep a diary or a plain text file sitting safely on your hard drive, kochanie?</description>

      <description>I am a post-doctoral researcher at the Institute of Philosophy and Sociology, Polish Academy of Sciences, and a recent Ph.D. graduate from the Department of Sociology, The Ohio State University. My research interests include comparative analyses of political attitudes and behavior across nations and over time, as well as the methodology of comparative research, in particular cross-national surveys.

      <description>Political Inequality I&amp;rsquo;m currently working as a post-doc in the project Political Voice and Economic Inequality across Nations and Time led by dr. Joshua K. Dubrow. In this project I use my knowledge of cross-national surveys and methodology to investigate how economic and educational inequality translates into political marginalization – a topic of renewed relevance in the current turbulent times. I develop country-level measures of political inequality using data from various sources: survey data, administrative records, event data, and others.</description>
