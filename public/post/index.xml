      <description>Getting and reshaping the dataThe Dot PlotResponding to the Storytelling with Data challenge #SWDchallenge, whose August edition stars the dot plot, here is a simple plot of the gender gap in voting in national elections using the most recent 8th Round of the European Social Survey, ESS.
Getting and reshaping the datalibrary(essurvey) # getting European Social Survey datalibrary(tidyverse) # data cleaning and reshapinglibrary(countrycode) # switching between country codeslibrary(ggplot2) # plotsWith the essurvey package the ESS data can be downloaded directly to R, while thanks to the tidyverse data manipulation boils down to a single block of code.</description>

      <description>InstructionsReferences In the previous post I wrote about downloading and exploring the Survey Data Recycling (SDR), version 1.0 dataset, which consists of selected harmonized variables from 22 survey projects, 1966-2013.
The SDR project will develop a website for browsing, subsetting, downloading, and visualizing data from the SDR project. This website is currently under construction. Meanwhile, I made a Shiny app with basic functionalities of the future on-line browsing and subsetting tool (also serves as its mock-up): https://mkolczynska.</description>

      <description>Getting data from TwitterTweets over timeText analysisTweets by ISA Resesarch CommitteeThe International Sociological Association 19th World Congress of Sociology in Toronto (15-21 July) has received quite some Twitter coverage. Waiting to board the flight back to Warsaw, I wanted to take a look at these Twitter data and apply the newly acquired skills in text analysis (thanks to the Summer Institute for Computational Social Science, SICSS, Partner Site in Tvärminne and Helsinki, Finland).</description>

      <description>This blog is going to be mostly about my adventures with R, primarily using survey data, and usually somewhat related to my social science interests; for the fun of it, to share code and hopefully get feedback.
How it all started General law of academia: The capacity for generating ideas is greater than the capacity of developing ideas into papers.
So why write a blog and not keep a diary or a plain text file sitting safely on your hard drive, kochanie?</description>
