In the [previous post](/post/sdr-exploration/) I wrote about downloading and exploring the [Survey Data Recycling (SDR), version 1.0 dataset](https://dataverse.harvard.edu/dataset.xhtml?persistentId=doi:10.7910/DVN/VWGF5Q), which consists of selected harmonized variables from 22 survey projects, 1966-2013.

The [SDR project](dataharmonization.org) will develop a website for browsing, subsetting, downloading, and visualizing data from the SDR project. This website is currently under construction. Meanwhile, basic functionalities of the future on-line browsing and subsetting tool are available here: https://mkolczynska.shinyapps.io/sdr_data_browser/
